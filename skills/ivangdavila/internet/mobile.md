# Mobile Connectivity — Internet

## eSIM vs Local SIM vs Roaming

| Option | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **eSIM** | Short trips, multiple countries | Instant, no physical card | Device must support, can't share |
| **Local SIM** | Long stays, heavy usage | Cheapest per GB, local number | Need unlocked phone, pickup hassle |
| **Carrier roaming** | Emergencies, short trips | No setup, same number | Expensive, often throttled |

## eSIM Providers Comparison

Popular options (2025):
- **Airalo** — Wide coverage, competitive prices
- **Holafly** — Unlimited plans, good for Europe
- **eSIM.me** — Budget option
- **Carrier eSIMs** — T-Mobile, AT&T international plans

Before purchasing:
1. **Verify device compatibility** — Settings → Cellular → check eSIM option exists
2. **Check destination coverage** — Not all countries/carriers supported
3. **Note data cap** — "Unlimited" often means throttled after X GB
4. **Check validity period** — Some expire unused

## Activating eSIM

```
1. Purchase eSIM (usually receive QR code via email)
2. Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM
3. Scan QR code or enter details manually
4. Label it (e.g., "Spain Trip")
5. Enable "Data Roaming" for that line
6. Set as primary for data when traveling
```

## Hotspot/Tethering Best Practices

When sharing connection:
- **Disable on home WiFi** — Saves battery
- **Set strong password** — Prevent strangers connecting
- **Monitor connected devices** — Kick unknowns
- **Track data usage** — Tethering burns through caps fast

Optimization:
- 5GHz band if both devices support (faster, shorter range)
- Disable background app refresh on connected devices
- Video calls: 720p uses ~1GB/hour, 1080p uses ~3GB/hour

## Data Conservation

When on limited data:
- Enable "Low Data Mode" (iOS) or "Data Saver" (Android)
- Disable auto-updates
- Download maps/content on WiFi before traveling
- Use WiFi for video calls when available
- Check which apps consume most data in settings
