# Provider Comparison — Internet

## Before Comparing

1. **Get user's address** — Coverage varies by street
2. **Check current contract** — End date, penalties, retention offers
3. **Understand usage** — Remote work? Gaming? Streaming? Large household?

## Comparison Framework

| Factor | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| **Real price** | Price after promo ends (usually month 13+) |
| **Total cost** | Installation + router + 24 months + penalties |
| **Technology** | Fiber FTTH > Fiber FTTC > Cable > DSL |
| **Upload speed** | Critical for remote work, often ignored |
| **Contract length** | Shorter = more flexibility |
| **Data caps** | Some "unlimited" has fair use limits |

## Hidden Costs to Flag

- Router rental fees (often €3-5/month hidden)
- "Free" TV packages that auto-renew at full price
- Installation fees waived only with 24-month commitment
- Price increases buried in terms ("may adjust annually")

## Negotiation Tactics

### For New Customers
- Ask for "best available offer" — web prices are rarely the best
- Mention competitor quotes with specific prices
- Request waived installation/router fees

### For Retention (Existing Customers)
- Call to cancel, not to negotiate
- Have competitor offer ready with exact details
- Retention department has better deals than sales
- Best time: 30-60 days before contract ends
