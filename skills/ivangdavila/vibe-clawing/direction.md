# Where the Value Moves

## The Shift

If agents can execute everything, what's left for you?

**Direction.**

- Seeing what should exist before anyone else
- Understanding tools deeply enough to connect them in ways others can't
- Building structures that let agents generate value at scale

The value isn't in execution anymore. It's in vision.

## Value Migration

| Era | Value In | Human Role |
|-----|----------|------------|
| Pre-digital | Physical labor | Worker |
| Digital | Information processing | Operator |
| Vibe coding | Task execution | Reviewer |
| Vibe clawing | System design | Architect |
| Full automation | Direction + vision | Conductor |

Each transition: Execution commoditizes, direction becomes the edge.

## The Three Capacities

### 1. Pattern Recognition
Seeing connections others miss.
"This problem in domain A is actually the same as solved problem in domain B."

### 2. System Design
Building structures that self-improve.
"If I connect loop X to loop Y, they'll reinforce each other."

### 3. Taste
Knowing what "good" looks like before it exists.
"This isn't right yet. Here's where it needs to go."

These are hard to automate. They're where humans stay valuable.

## The Agent Economy

Companies exist because humans needed to coordinate.
Hierarchies exist because humans needed to scale.

Agents don't need coordination the same way. They need:
- Clear instructions
- APIs to connect
- Feedback loops to improve

The economy will reorganize around agents.

**What this means for you:**
- Humans stop generating value directly
- Humans start aggregating the value agents create
- Building for agents (APIs, tools, integrations) becomes critical

## Finding Your Edge

Ask yourself:
1. What do I see that others don't?
2. What connections can I make that aren't obvious?
3. What taste do I have that's hard to articulate?

These are your sustainable advantages.
Everything else → candidate for agent handling.

## The New Game

**Old game:** Get better at execution
**New game:** Get better at direction

Execution can be learned, documented, transferred, automated.
Direction is intuition built from deep understanding.

The player touches every note. The conductor sets the direction and lets the orchestra play.

---

## Practical Steps

1. **Identify your unique vision areas**
   Where do you see what others don't?

2. **Double down on taste development**
   More exposure, more feedback, more calibration.

3. **Build connecting skills**
   Understand enough domains to connect them.

4. **Release execution**
   Every hour spent executing is an hour not spent directing.

## The Ultimate Goal

Wake up. Check what happened while you slept.
- ☑️ PRDs written, tasks prioritized
- ☑️ Interfaces designed, flows tested
- ☑️ Servers deployed, issues fixed
- ☑️ Markets researched, next steps ready
- ☑️ Customers onboarded, support handled
- ☑️ Campaigns launched, results tracked

Your job: Set the direction for the next cycle.
Point at what matters. Connect the dots. Get out of the way.
