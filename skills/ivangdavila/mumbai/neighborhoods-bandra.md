# Bandra & Western Suburbs

## Overview

The Western Suburbs stretch from Bandra to Borivali along the Western Railway line. This is where young Mumbai lives — trendy cafes, nightlife, Bollywood stars, tech workers, and a vibrant expat community. Generally more modern apartments, better infrastructure, and a younger vibe than South Mumbai.

**The Corridor**: Bandra → Khar → Santacruz → Vile Parle → Andheri → Versova → Lokhandwala → Goregaon → Malad → Kandivali → Borivali
