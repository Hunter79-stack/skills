## The Monsoon Deep Dive

### When It Arrives
- **Typical arrival**: June 10-15
- **Onset**: Often dramatic — first heavy rain after dry spell
- **Pattern**: Not constant rain; bursts followed by breaks

### Flooding Reality
Mumbai floods regularly during heavy monsoon spells:

**Why it floods:**
- City at sea level

- High tide blocks drainage

**Flood-prone areas:**
- Hindmata (Dadar)
- Milan Subway
- King's Circle
- Mahalaxmi
- Sion
- Santacruz underpasses
- Many local spots

**Check before moving to an area**: Ask locals about waterlogging history

### Working During Monsoon
- **Many offices close** during heavy rain days
- **Work from home** normalized during monsoon
- **Meetings cancelled** when rain is severe
- **Start early/late**: Avoid peak rain hours

### Monsoon Life Hacks
1. **Always have change of clothes at office**
2. **Umbrella in every bag**
3. **Quick-dry underwear** (not joking)
4. **Waterproof phone pouch**
5. **Extra socks at work**
6. **Anti-fungal powder** (humidity causes issues)
7. **Dehumidifier** for home
8. **Silica gel packets** in closets
