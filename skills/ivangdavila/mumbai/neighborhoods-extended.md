# Navi Mumbai & Thane

## Overview

Beyond Mumbai proper lie two major urban areas that offer dramatically better value for money: Navi Mumbai (a planned city across the harbor) and Thane (a historic city merged into Greater Mumbai). Both are increasingly popular with families and budget-conscious professionals.
