# Miles, Points & Loyalty

## Award Search
- Search multiple programs for same route — prices vary wildly
- Partner awards often cheaper than operating airline's own program
- "Saver" vs "Anytime" awards: saver worth waiting for, anytime rarely good value
- Sweet spots exist: know which routes are underpriced in each program

## Point Valuations
- Calculate cents-per-point: cash price ÷ points required
- Good value threshold: >1.5cpp for most programs, >2cpp for premium cabin
- Transfer bonuses (e.g., 30% Amex→Avianca): factor into calculation
- Never redeem at <1cpp — usually better to save points

## Earning Optimization
- Credit card category bonuses: know which card for flights, dining, etc.
- Portal shopping: stack with credit card for double/triple points
- Elite status earning: track qualifying miles/segments/spend
- Mileage runs: calculate cost-per-qualifying-mile when status is close

## Status Management
- Track progress toward requalification throughout year
- Unused benefits expire: upgrades, lounge passes, companion tickets
- Status match opportunities: check competing programs
- Credit card status: some cards grant automatic status (Amex Plat → Hilton Gold)

## Points Maintenance
- Audit balances monthly — some programs expire points after 18-24 months
- Small activity resets expiration clock (survey, shopping portal purchase)
- Orphan balances: burn small amounts before they expire worthless
- Consolidate when possible: household pooling, transfer between programs
