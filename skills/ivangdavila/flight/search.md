# Flight Search

## Multi-Platform Search
- Always check: Google Flights (trends), Skyscanner (meta), Kiwi (virtual interlining), direct airline sites
- Budget airlines often missing from aggregators — check Ryanair, EasyJet, Spirit, Frontier directly
- Use "Explore" features to find cheapest destinations from home airport

## Flexible Date Strategies
- Search ±3 days around target dates — can save 30-50%
- "Cheapest month" view for planning trips around price, not dates
- Mid-week flights (Tue-Thu) typically 15-25% cheaper than weekends

## Route Optimization
- Check nearby alternate airports (2h radius) — often significant savings
- Open-jaw itineraries (fly into A, out of B) can save vs. round-trip
- Separate one-way tickets sometimes cheaper than round-trip
- Long layovers (6-12h) as mini-trips — verify transit visa requirements

## Budget Airline Traps
- "€9.99 fare" becomes €80 after bag + seat + check-in fees
- Always calculate total cost with one carry-on bag minimum
- Some weigh cabin bags — know limits (Wizz: 10kg, Ryanair: varies by fare)
- Priority boarding often required for guaranteed overhead bin

## Family Search
- Filter for flights with 4+ adjacent seats available
- Check child policies: lap infant age limits, unaccompanied minor fees
- Verify stroller/car seat check policies (many airlines: free)
- Bassinet seats: limited quantity, request early
