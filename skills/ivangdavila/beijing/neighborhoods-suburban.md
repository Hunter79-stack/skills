## 🚗 Car Ownership in Suburbs

Living in suburbs (especially Shunyi) basically requires a car:

### Getting a Beijing Plate

**The Problem:** Beijing has a license plate lottery system

**Options:**
1. **Lottery:** Apply monthly, odds ~1/3000+ (years of waiting)
2. **Electric vehicle:** Separate lottery, better odds (~1/100)
3. **Company car:** Some companies have plates
4. **Rent:** Long-term rental with plates included
5. **Drive without:** Out-of-province plates restricted on some roads

### Plate Restrictions

| Plate Type | Weekday Restriction | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Beijing plates | 1 day/week (rotating) | Can't drive on 5th Ring+ certain day |
| Provincial plates | 7AM-8PM on 5th Ring+ | Severely limited |
| Electric (green) | None | Best option |

### Alternative: DiDi / Driver

Many Shunyi expats don't drive themselves:
- **Full-time driver:** ¥6,000-10,000/month
- **DiDi costs:** ¥100-200 per city trip
- **Car + driver rental:** Available through companies
