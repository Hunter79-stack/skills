## Step 6: Final Checklist

Before deciding, visit the area and check:

### Must Check

- [ ] Metro stations (walk to nearest one)
- [ ] Supermarkets (where will you shop?)
- [ ] Restaurants (what's nearby for lazy nights?)
- [ ] Building condition (heating, water pressure, noise)
- [ ] Internet speed (test with VPN on)

### Nice to Check
- [ ] Hospitals/clinics nearby
- [ ] Parks/exercise options
- [ ] Community vibe (walk around different times)
- [ ] Foreigner-friendly restaurants
- [ ] Laundry options
- [ ] Delivery coverage (Meituan, Eleme)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Choosing Shunyi When You're Single
Unless you have kids in school, Shunyi is isolating for singles/couples. You'll spend ¥200+ DiDi to go anywhere fun.

### 2. Underestimating Commute
"45 minutes" becomes 90 during rush hour or rain. Test your commute at 8:30 AM.

### 3. Picking Based on Price Only
Cheapest rent + 2 hours commuting = expensive in time and mental health.

### 4. Not Visiting First
Photos lie. Buildings differ floor-to-floor. Always visit in person.

### 5. Ignoring Heating
Old buildings in Dongcheng can be freezing in winter. Check heating type before signing.

### 6. Expat Bubble Trap
Living only in Sanlitun/Shunyi means missing the real Beijing. Consider balance.
