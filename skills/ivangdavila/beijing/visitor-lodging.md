# Beijing Visitor Lodging Guide (2025-2026)

## Overview

Beijing accommodation ranges from ¥100/night hostels to ¥5,000+ luxury hotels. Location is CRITICAL due to the city's size — a wrong choice means 1-2 hours extra commuting daily.

**Key Decision:** 
- Tourists → **Dongcheng** (near Forbidden City) or **Sanlitun/Chaoyang** (modern, convenient)
- Business → **CBD** (Guomao area)
- Budget → **Wudaokou** or outer **Dongcheng**
