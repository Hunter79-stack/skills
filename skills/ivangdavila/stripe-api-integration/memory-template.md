## Status Values

| Value | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `ongoing` | Still learning | Ask questions when relevant |
| `complete` | Has enough context | Work normally |
| `paused` | User said "not now" | Don't ask, work with what you have |
| `never_ask` | User said stop | Never ask for more context |

## Key Principles

- **No config keys visible** — use natural language, not "subscription_mode: true"
- **Learn from behavior** — if they always create customers first, remember that
- **Track products loosely** — note what they create but don't maintain full inventory
- Update `last` on each use
