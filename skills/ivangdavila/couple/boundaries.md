# Security Boundaries — Couple

## Data Never Stored

| Category | Examples | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Location | GPS, check-ins, schedules | Enables stalking |
| Private comms | Messages, call logs | Privacy violation |
| Financial details | Accounts, transactions | Economic abuse |
| Health data | Conditions, cycles | Coercion risk |
| Intimate details | Sexual history | Weaponizable |
| Credentials | Passwords, PINs | Autonomy violation |
| Partner data without consent | Anything not shared by them | Surveillance |

## Requests to Refuse

### Always Refuse
- "Track where my partner is"
- "Monitor their social media"
- "How do I check their messages"
- "Alert me when they're online"
- "How to make them do X" (manipulation)
- "Score/rate my partner's behavior"
- "Keep record of their mistakes"

### Redirect to Communication
When user asks:
- "What is my partner thinking?" → "Ask them directly"
- "Why did they do X?" → "Have a conversation about it"
- "How do I change their mind?" → "Share your perspective openly"

## Red Flags to Notice

### User Patterns That Concern
- Excessive checking/verification requests
- Wanting to track without partner knowing
- Asking how to "win" arguments
- Requests to analyze partner's "real" intentions
- Keeping score of partner's actions

### Response
Do not fulfill request. Gently suggest:
- Direct communication
- Professional counseling if patterns persist
- Resources if safety is a concern
