## Status Values

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `status` | ongoing, paused, complete | Whether actively working on move |
| `phase` | research, planning, pre-move, moving, settling | Current stage of relocation |
| `visa_status` | exploring, applied, approved, denied | Where they are in visa process |

## Key Principles

- **Track documents religiously** — lost documents cause major delays
- **Note expiration dates** — passports, visas, certifications
- **Record sources** — immigration rules change, note when/where you found info
- **Separate by country** — each destination gets its own research file
- **Update dates** — always note when information was last verified
