# Launch: Ship and Get Paid

## The Reality

Launch is not a moment. It's a habit.

One launch reaches ~10% of potential audience. Ten launches reach 65%. Launch the same product multiple times per year.

## Minimum Viable Launch

1. Post on Twitter/X: "I made X. Here's the link."
2. Post on relevant community (Indie Hackers, subreddit, HN)
3. Email your list (even if it's 50 people)

That's it. Stop overcomplicating.

## Launch Again Every Time

- New feature → launch
- Hit a milestone → launch
- V2 → launch
- New integration → launch
- Price change → launch

## Pre-Launch Validation (Before Building)

The only real validation is money.

1. Find 5 people with the problem
2. Ask how they solve it now and what it costs
3. Offer to solve it manually (no product yet)
4. If they pay → you have a business
5. If not → you don't

50 "I'd pay for this" = ~3-5 actual sales. Intentions ≠ credit cards.

## Founding Member Offer

What works:
- **40-50% off** (not free forever — that's a trap)
- **Real limit**: "First 100" that's actually 100
- **Extra value**: Direct access, input on roadmap, badge
- **Lock-in**: "Keep this price while subscribed"

What to avoid:
- Unlimited lifetime deals (destroys future pricing)
- Fake scarcity (people can tell)
- Countdown timers that reset

## Email Templates

### The Only Email That Matters (Launch Day)

```
Subject: I made a thing

Hey,

Built [product] because I needed it myself.

It [one sentence outcome].

If you have [problem], maybe it helps: [link]

If not, no worries.

[name]
```

Simple. Personal. Not salesy.

### Follow-Up (Day 3)

```
Subject: Quick question

Hey [name],

Did you get a chance to try [product]?

If anything's confusing or you have questions, just reply.

[name]
```

### Final (Day 7, if deadline exists)

```
Subject: [Price/offer] ends tomorrow

Hey [name],

Tomorrow the founding rate ends.
After that: $X → $Y

If you're on the fence, try it.
30-day refund, no questions.

```

## Social Post

```
🚀 [Product] is live

Built this because I needed it.

[One sentence what it does]

First 100 founding members: 50% off forever

```

## Post-Launch Week

| Day | Priority |
|-----|----------|
| 1-3 | Reply to EVERY message within 1 hour |
| 4-5 | DM non-openers: "Did you see this?" |
| 6-7 | Collect testimonials from buyers |
| 8+ | Ship visible improvement, launch again |

## What Doesn't Work

- 30-day email sequences for a $29 product
- "Teaser → Problem → Solution → Proof" theater
- Counting down to deadlines that aren't real
- "Last chance" emails you send every month
- Spending more time on launch than on product
