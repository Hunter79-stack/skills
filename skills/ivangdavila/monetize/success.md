# Success Patterns (And Failures)

## Timeline Reality

Most indie products take 12-18 months to reach $10K/month. Some take years. A few hit it in months. Survivorship bias makes you think everyone's path is fast.

**For every success story, ~50 similar products died under $100/month.**

## What Actually Works

### 1. Build For Yourself

You should be user #1. If you don't need it, you'll quit when it gets hard.

- Scratch your own itch
- Your frustration = fuel
- You understand the problem deeply
- **Test**: Would YOU pay for this?

### 2. Ship Fast, Iterate Faster

MVP in 2-4 weeks. Not 6 months.

- Zero tests in v1 (controversial but real)
- "Ugly but works" is fine
- First 10 customers don't care about polish
- Speed of learning > quality of code

### 3. Launch Multiple Times

One launch ≠ success. Launch the same product 5-10x per year.

- New feature = new launch
- Milestone = launch
- V2 = launch
- Different audience = launch

### 4. Price High, Serve Fewer

Counter-intuitive: raising prices 5x, losing 80% of customers, and DOUBLING revenue.

- $97/mo customers need LESS support than $9/mo
- Higher prices attract serious buyers
- Sell to SMBs and prosumers, not bargain hunters

### 5. Speed Is a Moat

Reply in <5 minutes. Build features live on calls. Ship what they ask THIS WEEK.

- Set alerts for niche keywords (Twitter, Reddit)
- Personalized Loom for every signup
- Look like a 10-person team as a solo founder

### 6. Charge From Day One

No "free beta." No waitlist that goes nowhere.

- If they won't pay $1, they won't pay $100
- Payment = commitment
- Pre-sell before building when possible

## What Doesn't Work

| Trap | Why It Fails |
|------|--------------|
| Paid ads early | No product-market fit = burning money |
| 12-month roadmap | Ship what they need this week |
| 95% test coverage | Speed wins early; tests come later |
| Huge markets | Compete with funded startups? No. |
| Waiting to be "ready" | Build while learning |
| Generous free tier | No urgency to upgrade |
| "Validating" with surveys | Promises ≠ payments |

## The Uncomfortable Formula

**Months 1-3**: MVP + launch (HN/ProductHunt) + first 10 paying customers

**Months 4-6**: SEO/content + referrals + iterate on feedback

**Months 7-12**: Raise prices + premium features + scale what works

**Daily work (variable, not a "routine"):**
- Some days: 12 hours debugging one issue
- Some days: 0 hours, doing nothing
- The only rule: ship something this week

## Stack Products, Not Features

One product = one income stream. Ten products = ten chances.

- Build variations: same tech, different niche
- Failed products get sold or become content
- 10 small products > 1 "big bet"

## The Mindset Difference

**Builders who struggle:** "Let me learn everything about monetization, then I'll launch."

**Builders who succeed:** "Let me put a payment link up and see what happens."

The best monetization strategy: stop reading about monetization and put a buy button on your site today.
