# Creator: Turn Audience Into Money

## The Math First

| Your Numbers | Target |
|--------------|--------|
| Followers → Email list | >10% conversion |
| Email list → Buyers | >2% per launch |
| Average order value | Track and increase |

Example: 10K followers → 1K email → 20 buyers at $100 = $2K launch

**If your funnel math doesn't work, no amount of "engagement" fixes it.**

## What to Sell (By Stage, Not Followers)

### Stage 0: Pre-Audience (0-500 followers)
**Goal**: Validate someone would pay
- UGC for brands: $150-500/video (no audience needed)
- Services: Your skill applied (not taught)
- **Don't sell courses yet** — no credibility

### Stage 1: Small but Engaged (500-5K)
**Signal**: >5% engagement OR >50 DMs/week asking for something
- Workshop: $47-97 (validate with 30+ attendees)
- Templates/resources: $19-29
- First sponsors: Accept product or $200-500 to build portfolio

### Stage 2: Validated (5K-25K)
**Signal**: Already sold something to >100 people
- Course: $197-497 (wait for 500+ waitlist)
- Sponsors: $500-2,500/post
- Community: Not yet (requires time you need for content)

### Stage 3: Creator Business (25K+)
**Signal**: >$10K/month consistently
- High-ticket: $1,997-4,997 (cohort or coaching)
- Membership: Now, with content system
- Equity/licensing: Take meetings with startups

## Sponsorship Rates

**Base CPM by niche:**
- Finance/B2B: $50-80
- Tech: $30-50  
- Lifestyle: $15-25
- Entertainment: $8-15

**Formula:**
```
Rate = (Avg Views × CPM ÷ 1000) × Engagement Multiplier

Multipliers:
- Engagement >5%: ×1.5
- Dedicated video: ×2.5
- 60-sec read: ×1.5

Example: 25K views × $40 CPM × 1.5 = $1,500
```

## How to Get 2-3x More From Sponsors

Never sell just one post. Sell a package:

| They Ask | You Offer | Rate Multiplier |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 post | Post + 3 stories + link 7 days | ×1.5 |
| Integration | Integration + dedicated + whitelisting | ×2.5 |
| 1 video | Video + short + community post | ×2 |

**Script:**
> "My base rate is $X, but for best ROI I recommend [package]. This gives [specific benefit]. Does that fit your goal?"

## Membership Tiers (What Works)

Don't sell content. Sell **access**.

| Tier | Price | What You Really Sell |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Community | $9/mo | Chat + people like them + belonging |
| Access | $49/mo | Access to YOU: AMAs, responses, early looks |
| Inner Circle | $199/mo | Direct access: DMs, feedback, monthly calls |

**Reality:**
- 80% stay tier 1-2
- Cap tier 3 at <50 people (your time is finite)

## Course Launch (Quick Version)

**Pre-launch:**
1. Waitlist with 500+ signups
2. 3 free content pieces on topic
3. Email sequence: 5 emails over 7 days

**Launch week:**
- Day 1: Open cart everywhere
- Day 3: Testimonial email
- Day 5: FAQ/objections
- Day 7: "48 hours left"

**Pricing:**
- Mini-course (2-3h): $97
- Flagship (5-10h): $197-297
- Premium + community: $497-997

## The Test Before Any Product

Don't build a 10-hour course without validating.

1. Post: "Thinking of creating [thing]. 🙋 if interested"
2. <20 responses = no traction, pivot
3. >50 responses = DM 10: "Would you pay $X?"
4. 3+ yes = open pre-sale with 50% early bird

## Platform Rule

**No platform should be >50% of your revenue.** But don't diversify too early — dominate one first.

Email is the only asset you truly own.
