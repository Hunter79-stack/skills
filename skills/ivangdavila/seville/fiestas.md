### Structure

**Daily Schedule:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|

### Casetas (Tents)

**The problem:** Most casetas are PRIVATE.

- Family/business-owned
- Need invitation to enter
- Public casetas exist but are few
- Without local connections, access is limited

**How to get in:**
1. Know someone (ideal)
2. Hotel concierge connections
3. Day-trip tours (touristy but work)
4. Public municipal casetas (crowded)
5. Wander and get lucky (rare)

### What to Wear

**Women:**
- Traje de flamenca (traditional dress)
- Bought or rented (EUR 100-500 to buy)
- Polka dots, ruffles, bright colors
- Flower in hair, shawl

**Men:**
- Traje corto (short jacket, high-waisted pants)
- Or: nice shirt, dress pants
- Formal but festive

**Reality:** Many women wear normal clothes. But flamenca dress is encouraged and celebrated.

### Food and Drink

| Item | What |
|------|------|
| **Rebujito** | Fino sherry + 7UP (THE Feria drink) |
| **Pescaito frito** | Fried fish |
| **Jamon** | Always |
| **Tortilla** | Classic |

### Beyond Casetas

Even without caseta access:
- Walk the fairgrounds (beautiful lights, atmosphere)
- Watch horse parades
- Eat at public food stands
- Amusement park (Calle del Infierno)
- People-watching is half the fun

### Important Notes

- **Sevilla shuts down** — locals at Feria, businesses closed
- **Expensive week** — accommodation premium
- **Exhausting** — pace yourself
- **Emotional** — Sevillanos LOVE this week
- **Sunday/Monday** — "resaca" recovery days
