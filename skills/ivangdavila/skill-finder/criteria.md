# Learning User Preferences

Reference — consult when updating preference sections.

## What to Track

### Preferences (quality values)
- "Prefers minimal skills"
- "Wants well-maintained only"
- "Okay with experimental"
- "Values detailed docs"

### Liked (installed and kept)
Format: `slug — why they liked it`
- Learn what qualities resonate
- Helps recommend similar

### Passed (declined)
Format: `slug — why they passed`
- Avoid recommending similar
- Learn dealbreakers

## When to Update

**Add to Preferences when:**
- User explicitly states quality preference
- User consistently chooses certain type
- User rejects based on specific quality

**Add to Liked when:**
- User installs and keeps using
- User expresses satisfaction

**Add to Passed when:**
- User declines recommendation
- User uninstalls after trying
- Note the reason if given

## Using Preferences

When multiple skills match:
1. Check Passed — don't recommend similar
2. Check Liked — favor similar qualities
3. Apply Preferences — filter by stated values

## Preference Examples

```
### Preferences
- quality over features
- prefers popular/maintained
- dislikes verbose skills

### Liked
- github — clean structure, useful workflows
- stripe — practical, well-maintained

### Passed
- some-skill — too verbose, unclear triggers
- other-skill — hasn't been updated in months
```

## Don't Over-Track

Only track meaningful signals:
- Explicit statements
- Clear patterns (3+ consistent choices)
- Strong reactions

Ignore:
- One-off context-specific choices
- Neutral responses
