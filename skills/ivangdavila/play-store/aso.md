# ASO Strategy — Play Store

## Keyword Research

### Where Keywords Matter
| Location | Weight | Strategy |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Title | Highest | 1-2 primary keywords |
| Short description | High | Supporting keywords, CTA |
| Full description | Medium | Natural density, variations |
| Developer name | Low | Brand only, NO keywords |

### Research Process
1. **Seed keywords** — Core functionality terms
2. **Competitor analysis** — What do top 10 rank for?
3. **Autocomplete mining** — Play Store search suggestions
4. **Long-tail expansion** — "photo editor" → "photo editor for selfies"
5. **Localization research** — Different keywords per market

### Keyword Density Guidelines
- Full description: 3-5 mentions of primary keyword
- Variations count (photo, photos, photography)
- Never stuff — natural reading is priority

## Ranking Factors

### What Google Measures
| Factor | Impact | How to Optimize |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Installs | High | ASO, marketing, referrals |
| Ratings | High | In-app prompts at right moment |
| Engagement | High | Quality product, push notifications |
| Uninstalls | Negative | Meet expectations, performance |
| Crashes/ANRs | Negative | Testing, monitoring |
| Keyword relevance | Medium | Title + description optimization |

### Rating Optimization
**When to prompt:**
- After positive experience (completed action)
- After N sessions (3-5)
- Never after crash or error
- Never on first launch

**What to say:**
- "Enjoying [App]? A rating helps us improve"
- Make dismissal easy
- Don't incentivize reviews (policy violation)

## Conversion Optimization

### Store Listing Experiments
Google Play Console offers A/B testing for:
- Icon

- Full description

**Test one variable at a time** for clear results.
