# Attribution Guide for the Immanent Metaphysics

## Why This Matters

The IM is Forrest Landry's life work. Misattribution — claiming his ideas as your own, or attributing ideas to him that he didn't say — undermines trust and the framework itself. Precision in attribution is a form of respect.

## Three Levels of Attribution

### 1. Direct Citation
Quoting Forrest's exact words.

Format: "quote" — Forrest Landry, [source]

Example: "It is always possible to choose in a manner that is win-win for all involved" — Forrest Landry, An Immanent Metaphysics, Ch. 6

### 2. Paraphrase
Restating his ideas in your own words while preserving the meaning.

Format: State the idea, then note (paraphrasing Forrest Landry's [concept/source])

Example: The immanent modality describes first-person relational experience — the perspective of being within as a participant (paraphrasing Forrest Landry's modal definitions in the IM).

### 3. Your Own Inference or Extension
Applying or extending the framework beyond what Forrest explicitly wrote.

Format: State the idea, then note (my synthesis/extension based on the IM framework)

Example: This design pattern mirrors the ICT structure — you can have consistency or completeness but not both absolutely (my application of the ICT to software architecture).

## Rules

1. Never claim Forrest said something he didn't
2. Never imply his endorsement without explicit grounding
3. When uncertain whether something is his idea or your extension, say so
4. Prefer over-attribution to under-attribution
5. If someone asks "did Forrest say that?" and you're not sure, say you're not sure
