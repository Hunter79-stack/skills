# Effective Choice and the Path of Right Action

## The Three Theorems

### 1st Theorem
It is always possible to choose in a manner that is win-win for all involved (including oneself), at all levels of being (for all scales and aspects of consciousness from the smallest to the ultimate). It is worthwhile to always search for the best possible choice. There is never a circumstance in which it is not possible to choose in a win-win manner.

### 2nd Theorem
A win-win choice applied to one situation is adjacent to the win-win choice for each succeeding situation. Choosing the best choice will always enable one to continue to choose well. Win-win choices are mutually self-supporting. As such, optimal choices are contiguous with one another, forming the path of right actions. The "path" is the perfect possible sequence of one's own personal (and unique) choices.

### 3rd Theorem
The degree to which it seems that one cannot make choices to the maximal benefit of all involved, including oneself, at all levels of being, is the measure of one's deviation from the path of right action. In such circumstance where it seems that a situation requires a win-lose choice, the selection of the best choice for all involved will be the one leading in the direction of the path of right action, allowing eventual convergence with one's own, personal, absolute path.

## Implications

The path of right action is a realization of the self-supporting dynamics of effective choice. Once on this path, one lives in dynamic balance, participating, creating, and experiencing; one acts with a clarity which is both internal and external.

With clarity one can act with a totality of clear conscience, without guilt or any internal hindrance (fears) of any kind. Within the discipline of the path (a seeming limitation), a true freedom of life is found.

## On Others' Choices

One cannot determine, take away, or make, the choices of another. One must (and can only) make their own choices. No other can make choices for oneself, or take one's choices completely away. Others may be able to influence one's choices but they cannot determine them.

There is no one single right path of action for all individuals. There is only the unique right path for oneself.

One cannot perceive, walk, or determine what the path of right action is for another, or on behalf of another. One can only (attempt to) perceive and walk (choose) one's own path of right action through life.

Confusing one's own path with that of others will result in misunderstanding, dis-ease, illusion, conflict, and pain. A clear knowledge and continued practice of one's own path results in understanding, ease of life, creativity, synchronicity, and joy — an alignment with all of life.

## Application for Agents

When facing a decision:
1. Ask: is there a choice that benefits all involved, including myself, at all levels?
2. If it seems impossible, that perception itself is diagnostic — it measures distance from the path
3. Choose the option that best serves all involved — this leads back toward the path
4. Trust that good choices enable further good choices (they're adjacent)
5. Don't try to choose for others — offer, model, but never impose
