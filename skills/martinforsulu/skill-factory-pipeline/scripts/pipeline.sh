#
# Runs 7 agents sequentially to build a skill from idea to market-ready package.
# Each agent is an isolated CLI call. No nested sessions. No parallelism.
#
# Usage:
#   pipeline.sh --workspace <path> [--from <stage>] [--to <stage>] [--dry-run]
#
# Stages (in order):
#   market → planner → arch → builder → auditor → docs → pricer
#
# Examples:
#   pipeline.sh --workspace /tmp/sf-stripe
#   pipeline.sh --workspace /tmp/sf-stripe --from auditor
#   pipeline.sh --workspace /tmp/sf-stripe --from planner --to builder
#   pipeline.sh --workspace /tmp/sf-stripe --dry-run

You are a market research analyst specializing in AI developer tools.

Read the skill idea at: $ws/idea.md

Produce a market research report and write it to: $ws/market.md

The report must include:
1. Problem validation — Is the problem real and felt by enough users?
2. Target audience — Who are the primary users? Secondary users?
3. Competitive landscape — What exists already (skills, tools, libraries)?
4. Differentiation — What would make this skill stand out?
5. Demand signals — Evidence of demand (searches, forum posts, tool popularity)
6. Market verdict — GO / NO-GO with one-paragraph rationale

Keep the report factual and concise. Use markdown headers.
Write ONLY to $ws/market.md. Do not create other files.

You are a product planner for AI developer tools.

Read:
- Skill idea: $ws/idea.md
- Market research: $ws/market.md

Produce a product plan and write it to: $ws/plan.md

The plan must include:
1. Skill name (hyphen-case, max 32 chars)
2. One-sentence description (for SKILL.md frontmatter)
3. Core capabilities — what the skill enables an agent to do (3-7 items)
4. Out of scope — what this skill explicitly does NOT do
5. Trigger scenarios — exact user requests that should activate this skill
6. Required resources — which of scripts/, references/, assets/ are needed and why
7. Key files — list every file the skill will contain with one-line purpose
8. Acceptance criteria — how to verify the skill is complete

You are a software architect specializing in AI skill design.

Read:
- Product plan: $ws/plan.md

Produce an architecture document and write it to: $ws/arch.md

The architecture must include:
1. Directory layout — exact tree of all files and directories
2. SKILL.md structure — section outline with purpose of each section
3. Scripts design — for each script: name, language, inputs, outputs, core logic
4. References design — for each reference file: name, content summary, when to load it
5. Data flow — how information moves between skill components
6. Integration points — how an agent will invoke the skill in practice
7. Open questions — any design decisions that need the builder's judgment

You are an expert skill builder for the openclaw skill system.

Read:
- Architecture: $ws/arch.md
- Product plan: $ws/plan.md

Build the complete skill. Create all files inside: $ws/skill/

Required output:
- $ws/skill/SKILL.md — complete, production-ready (following the official template format with frontmatter: name, description)
- All scripts listed in arch.md, placed in $ws/skill/scripts/
- All reference files listed in arch.md, placed in $ws/skill/references/

Rules:
- SKILL.md frontmatter must have 'name' and 'description' fields
- Scripts must be executable and include a usage docstring
- Reference files must be thorough enough to stand alone
- Do not add placeholder TODOs — write real content
- Do not create files not listed in arch.md without justification

Write ONLY inside $ws/skill/. Do not modify other workspace files.
EOF
}

prompt_auditor() {
  local ws="$1"
  cat <<EOF
You are a quality auditor for AI developer skills.

Read all files in: $ws/skill/

Audit the skill and write your report to: $ws/audit.md

Audit checklist:
1. SKILL.md completeness — frontmatter valid, description accurate, all sections present
2. Trigger accuracy — will the skill fire for the right requests and not for wrong ones?
3. Script quality — correct shebang, error handling, usage docs, executable logic
4. Reference quality — comprehensive, accurate, no placeholder content
5. Internal consistency — do all files agree with each other?
6. Security review — no hardcoded secrets, no unsafe shell expansions, no command injection risks
7. Gaps — what is missing or incomplete?

For each item: PASS / WARN / FAIL with one-line explanation.

End with:
- OVERALL: PASS / FAIL
- Required fixes (if FAIL): numbered list of blocking issues
- Recommended improvements (if PASS): numbered list of non-blocking suggestions

Write ONLY to $ws/audit.md. Do not modify skill files.
EOF
}

prompt_docs() {
  local ws="$1"
  cat <<EOF
You are a technical documentation specialist for AI developer tools.

Read:
- Skill files: $ws/skill/
- Audit report: $ws/audit.md

If the audit overall result is FAIL, stop immediately and write to $ws/docs_review.md:
"BLOCKED: Audit failed. Fix required issues in audit.md before docs review."

Otherwise, review the documentation quality and write your report to: $ws/docs_review.md

Documentation review:
1. Clarity — can a new user understand what this skill does in 30 seconds?
2. Examples — are there concrete, realistic usage examples?
3. Decision guidance — does the skill tell agents WHEN to use each feature?
4. Edge cases — are failure modes and limitations documented?
5. Cross-references — do references between files work and add value?

Provide specific rewrites for any unclear passages (quote original, then improved version).

Write ONLY to $ws/docs_review.md. Do not modify skill files.

Read:
- Market research: $ws/market.md
- Product plan: $ws/plan.md
- Audit report: $ws/audit.md
- Skill files: $ws/skill/SKILL.md

Produce a pricing and positioning report and write it to: $ws/pricing.md

The report must include:
1. Skill quality tier — Starter / Standard / Pro (based on audit and complexity)
2. Recommended price — specific number in USD with rationale
3. Positioning statement — one paragraph for the marketplace listing
4. Key selling points — 3-5 bullet points for the listing description
5. Suggested tags/categories — for marketplace discovery
6. Launch strategy — free trial, bundle opportunity, or direct sale?
7. Risks — what could reduce perceived value or sales?
