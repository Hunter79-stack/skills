  This skill provides a privacy-focused way to audit your financial portfolio. It reads a list of cryptocurrency addresses and stock symbols from a local configuration file (e.g., `portfolio.json`) and fetches their current values using public, read-only APIs. No private keys are ever requested or stored, ensuring maximum security. The skill then presents a summary of your holdings.
