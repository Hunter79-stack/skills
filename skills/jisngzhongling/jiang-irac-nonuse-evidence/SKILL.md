## What This Skill Does

This skill provides a dual-track evidence reasoning system for CNIPA 3-year non-use cancellation proceedings:

### Defensive Track（证据答辩）
Builds a document-ready, examiner-readable use-evidence chain.

### Offensive Track（质证审计）
Audits registrant’s evidence and generates structured cross-examination points.

No generic AI writing.  
No fabricated facts.  
No speculative conclusions.  
Only verifiable evidence-chain reasoning.

---

## Scope & Positioning

### Primary Scope
- CNIPA non-use cancellation (撤销连续三年不使用)
- Reexamination and administrative review stages

### Core Mission
Convert scattered materials into:

- Defensible use-evidence chains
- Targeted cross-examination frameworks

This is an evidence reasoning engine, not a template pack.

---

## Legal Basis (Bounded Sources)

This skill operates strictly within:

- PRC Trademark Law (2019)
- Implementing Regulations
- CNIPA Examination & Adjudication Guidelines
- Nice Classification / Similar Goods Table

Prohibited:
- Fabricated transactions
- Fake screenshots
- Invented timelines
- Unverified interpretations

---

## Core Framework

### IRAC Structure (Mandatory)

- Issue: define dispute focus
- Rule: statutory + guideline standards
- Application: evidence-to-element mapping
- Conclusion: go / stop-loss / supplement / attack

### SJ-6 Evidence Chain (Mandatory)

Each evidence item is evaluated under:

1. Authenticity
2. Relevance
3. Completeness
4. Temporal validity
5. Logical consistency
6. Cross-exam resistance

All evidence must be time-aligned and purpose-tagged.

---

## Risk Module (A–E)

All outputs include:

- Risk Level: A / B / C / D / E
- Risk Dimensions:
  - Substantive
  - Evidence
  - Procedural
  - Discretionary
- Stop-loss gates

---

## Supported Scenarios

### Defensive Track
- Use-period evidence building
- Evidence prioritization
- Goods/services mapping
- Trademark form control

### Offensive Track
Audit for:

- Fake contracts/invoices
- Mismatched goods
- Out-of-period use
- Self-produced evidence
- Illogical transactions
- Platform screenshot defects

---

## Input Requirements

Minimum input:

- Trademark number / class / goods
- CNIPA use period
- Evidence inventory (date/source/type)
- For attack: opponent exhibits

Incomplete input → conservative output.

---

## Output Modes

### Quick Mode
Rule summary + checklist + go/no-go

### Pro Mode
IRAC + SJ-6 + Risk + Action Plan

### Document Mode
Submission-ready structure:
- Evidence index
- Timeline table
- Proof mapping
- Examiner-readable reasoning
- Structured 质证意见

---

## Compliance & Hard Constraints

- No fabrication
- No speculation
- Always identify weakest link
- Cost-benefit stop-loss required

---

## Typical Use Cases

- 撤三答辩证据包构建
- 撤三质证意见生成
- 证据缺口诊断
- 成本控制评估
