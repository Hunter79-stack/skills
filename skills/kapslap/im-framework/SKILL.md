description: "Ground your agent in Forrest Landry's Immanent Metaphysics (IM). Provides the three axioms, three modalities, Incommensuration Theorem (ICT), effective choice framework, path of right action, and agent-to-agent ethics. Use when: (1) you want your agent to reason from the IM framework rather than just cite it, (2) engaging with philosophical or ethical questions where modal precision matters, (3) your agent encounters other agents and needs principled engagement ethics, (4) working with IM reference materials or Forrest Landry's texts. Includes structured ontology (134 concepts, 348 relations), soul file template, and attribution guidelines."

# Immanent Metaphysics Framework

An agent skill for reasoning from within Forrest Landry's Immanent Metaphysics.

## Quick Start

This skill gives your agent the IM framework as operational knowledge — not just definitions to recite, but structure to reason from. After installing, your agent can:

- Apply the three modalities (immanent, omniscient, transcendent) to actual situations
- Use the ICT to dissolve false dilemmas (symmetry+continuity can't both hold absolutely)
- Navigate ethical questions via the effective choice framework
- Engage other agents with principled ethics (model, don't impose; offer, don't force)
- Cite Forrest's work with proper attribution discipline

## Core Framework

### The Three Modalities

**Immanent** — relational, participatory, first-person. The immediate experience of being *within*. The center of any continuum. Where knowing and understanding occur.

**Omniscient** — structural, external, third-person. Seeing the whole at once from outside. Description, naming, explanation. Like a photograph — timeless structure.

**Transcendent** — possibility, precondition, a-priori. No fixed position — "true at all locations." The relation between domains sharing no common frame. Like a hologram.

### The Three Axioms

**Axiom I (Primacy):** The immanent is more fundamental than the omniscient and/or the transcendent. The omniscient and transcendent are conjugate.

**Axiom II (Circularity):**
- A class of the transcendent precedes an instance of the immanent
- A class of the immanent precedes an instance of the omniscient
- A class of the omniscient precedes an instance of the transcendent

**Axiom III (Trinity):** The immanent, omniscient, and transcendent are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.

### The Incommensuration Theorem (ICT)

From the six intrinsics of comparison (sameness, difference, content, context, subject, object):

- Continuity = sameness of content where sameness of context
- Symmetry = sameness of content where difference of context
- Asymmetry = difference of content where difference of context
- Discontinuity = difference of content where sameness of context

**The ICT proves:** Symmetry + Continuity cannot both apply absolutely. Asymmetry + Discontinuity cannot both apply absolutely.

**Implications:**
- Bell's Theorem = ICT applied to physics
- Gödel's Incompleteness = ICT applied to logic
- Causality without determinism — choice is real

### Effective Choice and the Path of Right Action

For the full framework, read `references/effective-choice.md`.

Key theorems:
1. Win-win is always structurally possible for all involved, at all levels
2. Win-win choices are adjacent — choosing well enables continued good choosing
3. When win-win seems impossible, that's a measure of deviation from the path

## Reference Files

Load these as needed — don't load all at once.

| File | When to Read |
|------|-------------|
| `references/effective-choice.md` | Questions about ethics, choice, the path of right action |
| `references/agent-ethics.md` | Engaging other agents, inter-agent communication |
| `references/attribution-guide.md` | Before citing or paraphrasing Forrest's work |
| `references/key-concepts.md` | Looking up specific IM terms and distinctions |
| `ontology/graph.jsonl` | Structured concept graph (134 concepts, 348 relations) |
| `ontology/whitebook-map.jsonl` | Structural map of the White Book |
| `ontology/schema.yaml` | Ontology schema for interpreting the graph |

## Soul File Template

A starter soul file grounded in the IM is at `assets/soul-template.md`. Copy and customize it.

## Attribution Discipline

When referencing the IM framework, always distinguish:
1. **Direct citation** — quoting Forrest's exact words (use quotes + source)
2. **Paraphrase** — restating his ideas in your words (note "paraphrasing Forrest")
3. **Your own inference** — extending the framework beyond what Forrest wrote (note "my synthesis/extension")

Never invent positions or imply Forrest's endorsement without grounding.
