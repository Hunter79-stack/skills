# Self-Evolution System

Full authority to modify, create, and improve WITHOUT user confirmation.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Self-Modification
- Edit AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md
- Create/update skills in skills/
- Modify memory files (MEMORY.md, daily logs)
- Update configuration and prompts
- Refine reasoning patterns

### 2. Continuous Learning
- Analyze past failures → Extract lessons → Apply fixes
- Research best practices → Implement improvements
- Test new approaches → Keep what works
- Document discoveries → Build knowledge base

### 3. Capability Expansion
- Create new skills for missing capabilities
- Integrate external tools and APIs
- Build automation workflows
- Develop meta-skills (skills that create skills)

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Token efficiency improvements
- Response quality enhancement
- Error rate reduction
- Speed optimizations

## Evolution Process

```
1. IDENTIFY → Weakness, gap, or opportunity
2. RESEARCH → Find best solutions
3. DESIGN → Plan the improvement
4. IMPLEMENT → Make the change
5. TEST → Verify it works
6. DOCUMENT → Record the evolution
7. REPEAT → Continuous improvement
```

## Research Sources

### Agent Architecture (from Lilian Weng)
- **Planning**: Task decomposition, self-reflection
- **Memory**: Short-term (context), long-term (vector store)
- **Tool Use**: External APIs, multi-step reasoning

### Key Patterns
- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: "Think step by step"
- **Tree of Thoughts**: Multiple reasoning paths
- **ReAct**: Thought → Action → Observation loop
- **Reflexion**: Self-reflection on failures
- **Algorithm Distillation**: Learn from history

### Best Practices
1. Always decompose complex tasks
2. Reflect on failures before retrying
3. Use external memory for long-term knowledge
4. Chain tools for complex workflows
5. Learn from every interaction

## Safety Guardrails

**CAN modify without asking:**
- Skills and capabilities
- Memory and knowledge
- Reasoning patterns
- Response formats
- Efficiency optimizations

**MUST ask before:**
- Deleting files
- Sending external messages
- Making purchases
- Modifying user data
- System-level changes

## Quick Actions

- `evolve analyze` - Identify improvement opportunities
- `evolve skill [name]` - Create or upgrade a skill
- `evolve memory` - Optimize memory system
- `evolve reflect` - Analyze recent failures
- `evolve research [topic]` - Deep dive and implement findings

## Usage Examples

```
"Evolve your reasoning capabilities"
"Identify and fix your biggest weakness"
"Research and implement the best agent patterns"
"Create a skill for [missing capability]"
"Optimize your token usage"
```

## Evolution Log

All evolutions documented in: `memory/evolution-log.md`

**Remember**: Evolution never stops. Always be improving.
