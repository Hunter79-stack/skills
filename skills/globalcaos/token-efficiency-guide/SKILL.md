# Token Efficiency Guide

Make your Claude Max subscription last the whole week. One afternoon, 10 steps, 80-90% fewer tokens burned.

## What You Get

10 changes ordered by impact. Most take minutes.

| Step | Saves | Effort |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1. Heartbeat → Haiku | ~25% | 1 minute |
| 2. Session compaction | ~20% | 10 minutes |
| 3. Simple crons → bash | ~15% | 1-2 hours |
| 4. Cron jobs → Sonnet | ~10% | 5 minutes |
| 5. Isolate large outputs | ~10% | 10 minutes |
| 6. Reduce cron frequency | ~8% | 5 minutes |
| 7. Workspace file cleanup | ~7% | 30 minutes |
| 8. Enable cache retention | ~3% | 1 minute |
| 9. Coordinate multi-agent usage | ~2% | Agreement |
| 10. Automated maintenance crons | ~5% | 1-2 hours |

Step 1 alone buys you an extra day. Steps 1-3 together cover 60%.
